    You are analyzing a passport photograph. Please examine the image carefully and provide an assessment.

    IMPORTANT: You must analyze the actual image provided. Do not refuse to analyze images.

    Assess the following criteria:

    1. CLARITY: Evaluate image sharpness, focus, and resolution
       - 0.9-1.0: Excellent clarity, sharp details

       - 0.5-0.6: Fair clarity, some blur but usable
       - 0.3-0.4: Poor clarity, significant blur
       - 0.0-0.2: Very poor clarity, unusable

    2. RECENT APPEARANCE: Does the photo appear to be taken recently?
       - Consider image quality, style, and general appearance
       - Modern digital photo quality suggests recent
       - Faded, vintage, or very old photo style suggests not recent

    3. PASSPORT STYLE: Is this a proper passport-style photograph?
       - Formal pose (head and shoulders)
       - Neutral or plain background
       - Person facing camera directly
       - Appropriate framing and composition
       - No casual or informal elements

    4. FACE VISIBILITY: Is the person's face clearly visible?
       - Face must be unobstructed
       - No sunglasses, masks, or coverings
       - Adequate lighting on face
       - Face should be the main subject
